# Data Directory

## Purpose of the `data/` directory

The `data/` directory contains both user-supplied inputs and generated data artifacts used by the application. The Streamlit app reads from this directory but does not modify its contents directly.

If expected files are missing or out of date, the app may appear incomplete or empty.

---

## Directory overview

The following directory structure is expected:

- `data/raw/drafts/`  
  User-supplied draft board CSV files.

- `data/config/`  
  Configuration data generated by scripts in the `scripts/` directory.

- `data/processed/`  
  Generated data artifacts written by scripts and loaded by the Streamlit app.

---

## `data/raw/drafts/`

This directory contains raw draft board CSV files provided after the draft has been completed.

These files are treated as inputs and are not read directly by the app. They must first be processed by transformation scripts before they are usable elsewhere in the system.

---

## `data/config/`

This directory is populated by scripts in the `scripts/` folder.

It contains configuration data derived from raw inputs and used by downstream logic. Files in this directory are not intended to be edited by hand.

---

## `data/processed/`

This directory holds generated data artifacts that the Streamlit app loads at runtime.

These files are written by scripts and refresh jobs and are treated as read-only by the app. If data in this directory is missing or stale, the app will reflect that state.
